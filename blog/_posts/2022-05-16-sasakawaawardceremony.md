John and I found this Japan-Scandinavia Sasakawa foundation grant, and we applied to get some money to go to Japan to visit the University of the Ryukyus and get some dialect data from Seizen Nakasone's old field notebooks. They are on microfilm because Japan is super old school and never makes digital versions of anything, so the only way to access the data is to go there yourself and copy it. They wouldn't even digitise it during covid! But anyway, any excuse to visit Japan! We are really looking forward to going, we'll use the data in our upcoming new tree for Japonic which is also very exciting! We are working on that together with the help of Chieh-Hsi Wu, a fabulous statistician from the University of Southampton, and also fellow Japanophile!

It was so cool to eat sushi with the Japanese Ambassador to Sweden and hear from all the other interesting researchers who got the same grant!
