# Kirchröadsj plat

This part of my page is dedicated to linguistic-y resources on my hometown dialect *Kirchröadsj plat* [kɪʁᵻ̯çʁʏə̯tʃ plɑt], spoken in Kerkrade (the Netherlands). Many speakers treat it as a variety of Limburgish (Low Franconian) because of geographic and sociocultural factors, but from a linguistic point of view it is a Ripuarian (Central German) variety.
