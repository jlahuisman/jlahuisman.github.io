# Kirchröadsj plat

This part of my page is dedicated to some linguistic-y resources on my hometown dialect *Kirchröadsj plat* [kɪʁᵻ̯çʁʏə̯tʃ plɑt], spoken in Kerkrade (the Netherlands). Many speakers treat it as a variety of Limburgish (Low Franconian) because of geographic and sociocultural factors, but from a linguistic point of view it is a Ripuarian (Central German) variety.

Kirchröadsj plat has partly undergone the High German consonant shift. Intervocalic /p/, /t/ and /k/ have shifted to /f/, /s/ and /x/.
