Hejsan, I'm John Huisman. I'm a KVHAA Research Fellow at Uppsala University (Sweden), and I study how languages vary across space and change over time, with a particular interest in the meanings of words.

Languages can use the same word with a slightly different pronunication like English *tree* and Swedish *tr√§d*, or even a completely different word, like German *baum*, but somet  

In my research, I look at the variation in how languages link words with their meanings.

Cross-linguistic work 

In order to do so, we need to know to things: (1) What are the *words* that a language , and (2) What are the conceptual categories 

This involves two challenges, (1) *quantifying* the relative 'goodness of fit' between words and their meanings, and (2) *reconstructing* the evolutionary histories of these words through time. As I'm interested in this question as it relates to language in general, I work with data from a variety of languages. However, I am most at home with the Japonic language family.

This places my research within the fields of **psycholinguistics**, **historical linguistics**, and **linguistic typology**.

I completed my PhD at Radboud University in Nijmegen (the Netherlands). For my thesis, I studied variation in form and meaning across the, focusing on words for body parts, colours, and cutting and breaking events, and was awarded the *cum laude* distinction. Before my PhD, I got a Bachelor's degree in Japanese at Zuyd University Maastricht (the Netherlands), followed by a Research Master in Linguistics at Tilburg University (the Netherlands).

Outside my research, I keep myself busy with music, video games, and exploring the Swedish outdoors in search of berries and mushrooms.
