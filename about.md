Hejsan and welcome! My name is John. I'm a linguist interested in language variation and change. Differences between languages can pop up everywhere, from pronunciation (English *green*, Swedish *grön*, Dutch *groen*), to vocabulary (English *body*, Swedish *kroop*, Dutch *lichaam*), and even semantics (English uses *cut* for both cutting with a knife and a pair of scissors, but these are different in Swedish -- *skära*; *klippa* -- and Dutch -- *snijden*; *knippen*).

Meaning is a fundamental aspect of language. We use language to capture the way we categorise and organise our experience with the world around us. The great diversity in experiences of people of different cultures has led to thousands of different languages across the globe. Studying this diversity helps uncover systematicity in the variation and increases our understanding of the nature and limits of language itself. 

Studies on widely disparate languages show us that they can differ in the number, boundaries, and prototypes of meaning categories they distinguish. However, modern-day differences between languages result from changes that happened in the past, so studying related languages provides historical persepctive and a unique potential to uncover the underlying mechanisms that have produced this variation. 

As such, I try to combine various insights by studying dialect areas (Limburg), language families of different sizes and time-depths (Japonic; Indo-European), as well as comparative work based on completely unrelated languages. My work is data-rich, building on primary language data collected from native speakers using standardised tasks to ensure comparable data. Collecting linguistic material with controlled methods allows for coordinated cross-linguistic comparison, which enhance the value of the individual language data points significantly, as the work becomes more than a description on its own. The advantage of rich linguistic data is the potential to conduct fine-grained quantitative analysis.

I completed my PhD at Radboud University in Nijmegen (the Netherlands), conducting fieldwork across Japan to investigate semantic variation in colour vocabulary, the body part lexicon, and expressions for cutting and breaking events. In addition to the contribution to cross-linguistic comparative work, this also contriubted to the documentation and description of the endangered but understudied Ryukyuan languages spoken in the south of Japan.

Before my PhD, I completed a Bachelor's degree in Japanese at Zuyd University Maastricht (the Netherlands), followed by a Research Master in Linguistics at Tilburg University (the Netherlands). During this time, I also worked as a research assistant on several projects involving cross-modal associations and the language of perception (colour, smell, taste, and temperature).

Outside my research, I keep myself busy with cooking -- and eating! -- all kinds of delicious dishes, playing music and video games, and exploring the Swedish outdoors in search of berries and mushrooms.
